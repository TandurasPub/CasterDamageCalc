SpellDamageCalc will eventually have a GUI interface for generating spells / gear sets to compare the damage/cast and DPS for different spells and classes. 

Tester is currently all of the functioning Damage Calc code in text output. 
Edit the JSONs to get the gearsets you want/end up running most frequently to get the damage calcs to line up with what you want. 


TODO: 
    Limb Calculations (in extended damage detail sections)
    The GUI (gross)
    It will probably just being another TKinter shit box like the previous to get it working
    Add Spell Generator to create new spells and damage profiles 
    Add Gear Profile Generator to create new gearsets for comparisons 
    Add Data visualization portions for spells + additional damage breakdowns
